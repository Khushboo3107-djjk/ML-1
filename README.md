# 🧠 Parkinson’s Disease Detection using Machine Learning  

Detect Parkinson’s disease early using **machine learning models** trained on patient data. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes and quality of life.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to:  
- Classify patients as **Parkinson’s** or **Healthy** using biomedical features.  
- Explore feature importance for disease prediction.  
- Compare multiple machine learning models to select the most accurate.  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn`  
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
