**Handwritten Digit Classification using Machine Learning**

This project classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using machine learning. The model learns from images and predicts digits, useful for applications like automated forms and postal code recognition.

**Project Overview**

Built a machine learning pipeline for digit classification

Used image preprocessing and feature extraction to improve accuracy

Compared multiple algorithms to find the best-performing model

**Tech Stack**

Language: Python

Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow/keras

Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, CNN (optional)
